This project was a server that has a database of planets and there general distance from earth. it also has other data like the nearest star to it, the name of the planet, and other values that would be important when looking at an exoplanet for potential habitation. the idea behind this table is that the user would be able to filter the data of the table to what they need. the idea behind this was that it would be fun to make a tool such that if the earth were in danger and people needed to find a new planet to live on they could use this to find the closest exoplanet that meets there requirenments.

This project was a crime map that has all the crime data in the stpaul area. the crime is separated by neighborhood, type of crime, and a few other variables related to the crime. it has an interactive table and map. the map has all teh neighborhoods designated and allows you to click on a location creating a pin there. The table dynamically changes based on the visible neighborhoods on the map and allows you to pin any crime to the map. you can also filter the map by the severity of the crime as well. this system allows you to easily visualixe crime within the saintpaul area and allows for a variety of ways for you to filter the data.

This project was a simple graphics project with the goal of creating 2-d ojects and giving them animated properties. it has a couple of scenes you can move through with the first one being a ball that has velocity and bounces around the screen, the second scene has diamond shaped objects that grow and shrink at different speeds and to different limits. The last scene has some more diamond that are rotating in different directions and at different speeds. with these three differnet animation types you can mix and match them to make more complex and interetsing animations. these files are limited to working on  2-D objects only but can be added onto any 2-D object made in the same way.
